# DynamicConfig

Sometimes during development of mobile apps you encounter a situation when you want to have some configurable options but still don't want to have a server or have not time to setup a backoffice for all that stuff.
A file like settings.json put somewhere to dropbox/whatever free file hosting can solve your problem.

This library can help you.
